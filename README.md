Here are the problems which I solved for interview preparation

# Missing number in array 

Given an array of size N-1 such that it can only contain distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

#  Majority Element

Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.

# Leaders in an array

Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.
